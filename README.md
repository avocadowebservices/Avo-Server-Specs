## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Why does CPU Load say 'Not available on AWS'?**  
A: Some AWS and cloud hosts don’t provide system CPU info due to virtualization or security. The widget detects this and shows a friendly note.

**Q: Can I suggest features?**  
A: Please do! Use GitHub issues or discussions.

**Q: Can I use this for clients, agencies, or on unlimited sites?**  
A: Yes, forever—MIT licensed.
