## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Why does CPU Load say “Not available on AWS”?**  
A: Some cloud/VM hosts restrict CPU info. The widget detects this and explains it.

**Q: Can I use this on unlimited sites or for clients?**  
A: Absolutely. MIT licensed, forever.

**Q: How can I suggest features or contribute?**  
A: [Open an issue](https://github.com/avocadowebservices/avo-server-widget/issues), [discuss ideas](https://github.com/avocadowebservices/avo-server-widget/discussions), or send a pull request!
